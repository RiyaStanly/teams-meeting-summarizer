The team held a Q4 product planning session to discuss the mobile app redesign and infrastructure improvements. User research revealed that 78% of users want dark mode due to eye strain, and better notification controls are needed. The team decided to prioritize dark mode implementation for the December 10th release with two engineers allocated. Infrastructure concerns were raised about handling a 40% increase in API calls during the holiday season. A $15,000 budget increase was approved for AWS upgrades and caching implementation. The search functionality optimization will be included in the infrastructure upgrade. Enterprise tier pricing was set at $89/user/month to stay competitive with Salesforce and HubSpot while adding premium support.

**Action Items:**
- Marcus's team to implement dark mode by December 10th
- David to submit $15,000 infrastructure budget request to finance by Friday
- David to upgrade AWS instances and implement caching
- David to optimize search functionality and database indexing
- Lisa to create enterprise pricing comparison materials by next Tuesday
- Team to reconvene next Monday for progress tracking

**Key Decisions:**
- Dark mode prioritized for December release
- Infrastructure budget increase of $15,000 approved
- Enterprise pricing set at $89/user/month with premium support

**Risks:**
- Potential delays from AWS provisioning (David will escalate if needed)

**Participants:**
