The healthcare team conducted a patient care coordination meeting to review 12 new admissions with three high-priority cases. Patient John Anderson (room 304) was stabilized on supplemental oxygen after presenting with acute respiratory distress and oxygen saturation of 88%. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates indicating pneumonia, and he was started on IV antibiotics. Post-operative patient Maria Gonzalez (room 412) developed a fever of 101.5°F on day 2 after hip replacement surgery; surgical site appears clean with fever likely due to inflammatory response rather than infection. Elderly patient Thomas Wright (room 215) presented with increased confusion over 48 hours, suspected UTI causing delirium with urinalysis ordered. The patient safety pharmacist identified potential medication-related confusion in Mr. Wright requiring a reconciliation review.

**Action Items:**
- Nursing staff to check vitals every 4 hours for Maria Gonzalez
- Dr. Patel to monitor Maria's temperature; consider broad-spectrum antibiotics if fever exceeds 102°F
- Susan Lee (pharmacist) to complete medication reconciliation review for Thomas Wright by end of day
- Michael Torres to research assisted living options for Thomas Wright by Thursday
- Michael Torres to follow up with IT regarding EHR training invitations
- Kevin O'Brien to secure nursing coverage for Saturday night shift
- All staff to complete new electronic health record system training by November 1st

**Key Decisions:**
- Start acetaminophen for Maria Gonzalez's fever management
- Defer discharge planning for Thomas Wright until condition stabilizes
- Limit new admissions if weekend staffing shortage cannot be resolved

**Patient Status Updates:**
- John Anderson: Stabilized, oxygen saturation improved to 95%, on IV antibiotics
- Maria Gonzalez: Fever 101.5°F, surgical site clean, monitoring for infection
- Thomas Wright: Increased confusion, UTI suspected, medication review needed
- Four patients scheduled for discharge today with completed paperwork

**Upcoming Challenges:**
- Weekend nursing shortage (one nurse short on Saturday night)
- New EHR system implementation next month requires training completion

**Participants:**
- Dr. Amanda Martinez (Lead Physician)
- Dr. Rebecca Patel (Attending Physician)
- Nurse Kevin O'Brien (Charge Nurse)
- Pharmacist Susan Lee
- Social Worker Michael Torres
