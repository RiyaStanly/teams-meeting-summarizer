[10:15 AM] Sarah Chen: Good morning everyone! Thanks for joining our Q4 product planning session.

[10:15 AM] Marcus Johnson: Morning Sarah! Excited to discuss the roadmap.

[10:16 AM] Sarah Chen: Let's start with the mobile app redesign. Lisa, can you give us an update on the user research findings?

[10:16 AM] Lisa Rodriguez: Absolutely. We surveyed 500 users last month and the top request is a dark mode interface. 78% of respondents mentioned eye strain during evening usage.

[10:17 AM] Marcus Johnson: That's consistent with what we've been hearing from customer support tickets.

[10:18 AM] Lisa Rodriguez: We also found that users want better notification controls. Many feel overwhelmed by the current notification frequency.

[10:19 AM] Sarah Chen: Great insights. Let's prioritize dark mode for the December release. Marcus, can your team handle the implementation?

[10:19 AM] Marcus Johnson: Yes, we can allocate two engineers starting next week. Estimated completion by December 10th.

[10:20 AM] David Kim: I have concerns about the backend infrastructure. Are we prepared for the expected 40% increase in API calls during holiday season?

[10:21 AM] Sarah Chen: Good point David. What do you recommend?

[10:22 AM] David Kim: We should upgrade our AWS instances and implement caching for frequently accessed data. I'll need a $15,000 budget increase for infrastructure.

[10:23 AM] Sarah Chen: Approved. Please submit the formal request to finance by Friday.

[10:24 AM] Lisa Rodriguez: One more thing - we received feedback about the search functionality being slow. Can we address this?

[10:25 AM] David Kim: Yes, we've already identified the bottleneck. It's the database indexing. We can optimize this alongside the infrastructure upgrade.

[10:26 AM] Sarah Chen: Perfect. Let's also discuss the enterprise tier pricing. Marcus, thoughts on the competitor analysis you completed?

[10:27 AM] Marcus Johnson: Salesforce and HubSpot are pricing similar features at $99/user/month. I recommend we stay competitive at $89/user/month but add premium support.

[10:28 AM] Sarah Chen: That sounds reasonable. Lisa, can you work with marketing to create the pricing comparison materials?

[10:28 AM] Lisa Rodriguez: Absolutely, I'll have a draft by next Tuesday.

[10:29 AM] Sarah Chen: Excellent work everyone. To summarize: dark mode by December 10th, infrastructure upgrade approved, search optimization in progress, and enterprise pricing at $89/month. Any risks or blockers?

[10:30 AM] David Kim: Only risk is potential delays from AWS provisioning. I'll escalate if needed.

[10:30 AM] Sarah Chen: Thanks David. Let's reconvene next Monday to track progress. Meeting adjourned!
